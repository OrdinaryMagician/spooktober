HUBD_14 = "Seeing as you are quite skilled in... your profession... I'm sure you could be of assistance, so please, hear me out.";
HUBD_15 = "You may have noticed those large paintings already. These are portals to other worlds, each more terrifying than the last.";
HUBD_16 = "We believe that by exterminating the evil within them, the barriers will weaken, clearing the way to the rest of the mansion.";
HUBD_17 = "Once my brothers and I are all reunited, we should be able to draw out the evil master. Then... he's all yours, I guess...";

// Dialogue exhausted
HUBD_115 = "I must say, I'm impressed by how easily you're handling this...";
// Unlocked Basement
HUBD_116 = "I can feel a great surge of power down in the basement. The fiend must be hiding there.";
HUBD_117 = "We will go on ahead and reunite with brother Alfred. It's time to get to the bottom of this...";
// Moved to Basement
HUBD_118 = "The final painting... So this is where he's hiding...";
HUBD_119 = "Well, I'm sure you are eager to confront the beast, so let's not waste any time.";
// Dialogue exhausted
HUBD_120 = "Good luck, friend...";
